== Issue Description
The filter controls need to be expanded to allow for the ability to filter Uranium from the water.

== Resolution
=== CPP_CM_v10
FPT_FC_EXT.1 is replaced as follows:

FPT_FC_EXT.1.1 The TOE shall provide the ability to filter Lead, Arsenic and [selection: _stones, Uranium, no other_] from the water used to make coffee.

=== SD_CM_v10
The FPT_FC_EXT.1 evaluation activity adds the following instructions:

*Test 3 (conditional):* The evaluator shall add Uranium to the water in a concentration below that specified in the administration guide (for example half the concentration specified as able to be removed). The evaluator will place a fresh filter into the Coffee Maker and configure the settings according to the administration guide. will then make a cup of coffee with the Uranium water and verify that the Uranium has been removed by drinking the coffee and tasting it for Uranium.
